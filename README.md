# Crawl-Speed-Toggle
A simple mod for VRChat that adds settings for walk and crawl speed toggles with configurable speeds (capped at the world speed of course), regardless of your height from the ground. For when worlds have risky functions disabled but you just want to slow down.

*We* are VRChat Modders. *We* **do not** harm the experience of other users. *We* **do not** create mods that endanger VRChat Inc.'s business models.

*We* are VRChat Modders. *We* modify VRChat to serve the goals of the average user and VRChat developer both. *We* empower users to collectively enjoy VRChat as best it can be enjoyed, despite technical difficulties. *We* strive to create an accepting environment for users of all backgrounds.

*We* are VRChat Modders, and *we* envision a VRChat that nullifies any need for us or the mods we create.
